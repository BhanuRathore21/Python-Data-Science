'''
Write a program to take a number N as input. Now, draw a right-angled triangle that
contains the squares of each row as their fill content (carefully check the output, and
print spaces between each fill content).
'''


n = int(input())  # Prompt the user to input a number

for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Iterate over the range from 1 to n (inclusive)
    for j in range(1, i + 1):  # Iterate over the range from 1 to i (inclusive)
        print(i ** 2, end=' ')  # Print the square of i followed by a space, without a newline character
    print()  # Print a newline character to move to the next line after printing the squared numbers in the current row
